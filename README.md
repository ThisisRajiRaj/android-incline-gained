# android-incline-gained
An Android app to calculate vertical change in feet or meters based on 
distance traveled horizontally and vertical grade %. I made this app 
as I was training for a backpacking trip and wanted to know how much 
training I should do on the treadmill - what incline and for how long - to 
prepare for my trip.

The math is pretty simple.
```
Vertical_rise_in_metres = (Grade * 100) / Distance_in_meters
```

The project was made using Android Studio.
